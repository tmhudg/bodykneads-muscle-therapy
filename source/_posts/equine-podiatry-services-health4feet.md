I specialize in restoring the balance to the equine hoof.

Most of my work is correcting imbalances. From distorted flat feet, hooves lacking depth and volume, to upright narrow feet that look like soup cans. Regardless of whether your horse has had laminitis or just in general poor feet his whole life there is help!<!-- more -->

For examples of my work, please visit the Health4Feet Facebook page.

I specialize in composite shoe application and trim to balance the hoof capsule around the center of rotation of the coffin joint. I utilize hoof mapping to accurately balance and continue to improve the alignment of the hoof and limb, as well as improve overall health of the hoof and its internal structures.
