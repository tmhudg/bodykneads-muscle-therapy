This demonstration is designed to teach you how and why to stretch your horse. Christine and Bugzy will demonstrate 22 different stretches performed from the ground.<!-- more -->

You will see how the neck should be able to flex at each vertebrae and the horse should be able to move his neck laterally (to each side) from three different positions. You will learn the proper positions to ask for horizontal extension & flexion and lateral extension and flexion of the neck.

Next you will see how the shoulder and forelimb should be able to move in 6 directions: up down, left & right, forward and back. You will learn the stretches to promote good range of motion for the joints of the forelimb. Shoulder, elbow, knee and fetlock.

You will see the same positions and motions for the hind limb joints hip, stifle, hock and fetlock.

The trunk of the horse is often where most of the restriction manifests itself.

The ribs should be able to flex up and down and the horse should be able to contract the ribcage to either side(lateral flexion of trunk) using the intercostal and back & trunk muscles. The spine should be supple and the horse should be able to perform dorsi flexion (lifting up) and extension (contracting down) at the sacrum and lumbar area as well as at the withers. You will see these positions demonstrated.

It is very important for your horse to have full range of motion of all his joints. Why?

Any time a joint motion is compromised the other parts of the body will be affected via the nerve reflex loops called reciprocal inhibition. This is an involuntary reflex message sent from the joint to the spinal cord and then back to the muscles that support the joint. This response tells the muscles where the joint is in itâ€™s space and whether or not to contract or relax a supporting muscle group. If the horse has too many joints that are not working in proper alignment the muscles will spasm around those joints and start to make the motion stiff and rigid. The more the horse moves the more spasm and pulling occurs and the stiffer the horse will get.

These stretches are safe and easily learned by the horse and owner.
