I own a FLIR thermal imaging camera which can be used to detect changes in temperature or circulation via the use of color representing temperature.<!-- more -->

The camera is accurate within 1° of temperature and can be used to detect temperatures below 40 and up to 150°. I can check pressure points from saddles and clothing, look for inflamed joints and a variety if other things. This is a very helpful tool.
