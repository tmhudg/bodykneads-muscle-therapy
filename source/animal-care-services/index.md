When I see a client, be it human or equine, all these modalities are at my disposal and I use them interchangeably as needed.

If your horse has an injury I may look for inflammation with my thermal imaging. I may use the laser or massage or try to improve the range of motion with stretching and often I apply kinesiology tape. In fact I may do all of these in one session.
