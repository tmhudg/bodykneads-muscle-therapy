When I see a client, be it human or equine, all these modalities are at my disposal and I use them interchangeably as needed.

If you have an injury I may look for inflammation with my thermal imaging. I may laser you, massage or try to improve your range of motion with stretching and often I apply kinesiology tape. In fact I may do all of these in one session.
